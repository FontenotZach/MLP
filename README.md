# ML_Activity_Prediction
The Machine Learning Pipeline is a tool allowing for model generation through logistic regression and neural network algorithms.  The pipeline currently takes pressure sensor data from a specialized shoe, generting a model for predicting what acticty a user is doing, but can also be reconfigured for other uses.
